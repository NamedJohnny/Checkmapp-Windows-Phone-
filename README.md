# Checkmapp-Windows-Phone-
A windows phone application that allows people to manage their pictures, locations and notes from their trips.

# Installation
You will need :
* Visual Studio
* Windows Phone SDK 8.0 (or later)
* Multilingual App Toolkit (http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/2/4/324B517B-F5A3-480A-AAE0-DDB522358E96/MultilingualAppToolkit.msi)

# Why Windows Phone??
I think there is a lack of application on the Windows Store and I want to provide some effort to help the Windows Phone Community.
